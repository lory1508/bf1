   "description": "Auby-les-Hesdin was the location of a major supply depot on the western front during the Great War. According to historical records this supply hub and the railways in the area were manned and maintained almost exclusively by the CLC.\n\nthe Chinese Labour Corps - Although China would officially declare war on Germany in 1917 after a German torpedo sunk a ship carrying chinese civillians, a considerable number of Chinese citizens had already been involved in non-belligerant roles since 1916 through the Chinese Labour Corps (CLC). Around 140.000 men were enlisted, mostly poor farmhands from northern China and younger students to serve as translators. The CLC performed grueling jobs in harsh conditions for little to no pay in the rear lines: building and repairing roads and railways, unloading cargo from ships and trains, building fortifications, digging trenches, filling sandbags, constructing munitions depots and other such tasks were their main focus.\nThe CLC's significant contribution was barely recognised at the end of the conflict.; The men of the Labour Corps were, in fact, denied te right to settle or receive citizenship. Even today their memory remains mostly erased: of the circa 40,000 British Great War memorials not one remembers the deeds of the CLC."

Bapaume finds itself in a strategically valuable position: the town sits on the border between the Flanders plains and the flatlands north of Paris.\n During the great war Bapaume was considered a strategic location and it exchanged hands many times; Captured by the advancing German army in 1914, it was then retaken by the British in 1917 in the context of the Battle of the Somme. In early 1918 Bapaume was recaptured by the Kaiser's army, only to finally fall back into entente hands a few months later.\n\nthe bombing of town hall - in March 1917 the retreating Germans rigged Bapaume town hall with several explosive devices. One of such devices would be missed by British sweeps of the building, and the delayed explosion caused the death of 24 people including Australian soldiers, Australian civillians, and 2 deputies of the French Parliament."

The battle took place during the first stages of the great war on 30 August 1914. An entire sector of the front was left unmanned by the Austro-Hungarians, the missing army either still deployed in the balkans or on its way on the slow imperial railway network. The Russians exploited this pushing west and scoring a decisive victory in the first months of the conflict."

The operation started on 1 May with the Germans and Astro-Hungarians heavily shelling the poorly-fortified Russian positions, followed by infantry advancements that, in some cases, completely destroyed Russian divisions. By 6 May according to August von Mackensen's comment \"Along the entire line from the Vistula far into the Carpathians, the enemy is retreating\". More and more successful advances from the Central Powers caused the Russian armies to completely retreat from Galicia, the offensive officialy drawing to a close in October due to unfavourable weather conditions.\n\nthe galician oil fields - Although a fairly undeveloped region of the empire, Galicia was the Central Powers' only domestic oil-producing region. The wells around Borysław fueled the empire both in peace and war times. The Geman navy also heavily relied on Galician oil, which made the victory scored in battle of Gorlice-Tarnów very consequential to the continuation of marine warfare in the North Sea."

   "description": "In 1917 the German army launched the last major offensive operation on the eastern front: the Battle of Riga, a.k.a. the Battle of Jugla, after the river that flows near the city. \nThe plan was to put pressure on the northern sector of the eastern front and threaten the Russian capital Petrograd forcing Russia to accept a peace treaty. On 1 September German divisions started moving towards Riga, splitting in two groups: the first would march north to the city, the second one would intercept Russian foces along the Jugla river. Most of the fighting occured in the vicinity of the Jugla, while the first group entered Riga almost without resistance since the Russians had time to retreat.\nAlthough the casualties were minimal on both sides, the battle was a success for the Central Powers, that now threatened the Russian empire's industrial core.\nThe Battle of Jugla was followed by Operation Albion, an amphibious assault on several isles in the Baltic Sea. The in-game map \"Albion\" takes place during this offensive."

The battle itself started on 4 June 1916 with artillery bombardment over the Austro-Hungarian defences opening gaps in the barbed wire fortifications. After the shelling, which lasted several hours, the infantry started its advance, often catching Austro-Hungarian soldiers by surprise and either capturing them without a fight or prompting a chaotic retreat. The Central Powers' forces tried minor counterattcks to no avail: in just a handful of days around 130.000 men were either captured, dead, or MIA. The result of this battle even convinced Romania to join the war on the side of the Entente.\nThe Brusilov offensive continued beyond the Battle of Lutsk, eventually losing momentum and stopping in September."

It was his flamboyant and daring behaviour that antagonised many in the US Army General Staff, setting him up for a troubled carreer after the war's end.\nIn 1918 he planned and led the air detachement of the Battle of Saint-Mihiel.\nMitchell is also known for his role as a strong proponent of naval aviation tactics in the inter-war period."

The Italians split in two, with one section attacking the defensive lines head-on and the other flanking them. The infantry whose orders was to attack from the front faced machinegun fire and chemical weapons, yet after huge losses managed to break the Austro-Hungarian line wherefrom the enemy couldn't retreat because of the flanking army that engaged them, sometimes even in fierce hand-to-hand combat. Although a strategically valuable victory for the Kingdom of Italy, the battle inflicted heavy casualties on both sides."

This mistake is very common among English native speakers; Just on the BBC's website around 1000 occurrences of this misspelled name can be found. The origins of this ortographical error are not known, although some speculate it might have some relations to the stereotype of the \"Guido\" among Italian immigrants,."

These weapons found their way into the hands of the Boxers during the 1900 rebellion and contributed to the success of the Wuchang uprising which would lead to the end of the Quing dynasty in 1912.\nAfter the Great War the Hanyang Arsenal started producing copies of weapons used in the conflict like the Browning M1917 and the Mauser C96. The arsenal was also involved in the production of General Liu rifle prototypes, the project never seeing completion due to the death of General Liu and the loss of the equipment and machine tools necessary for production in an accident at sea."

   "description": "Espionage operations were carried out fairly frequently during the Great War aiming to thwart enemy schemes, conceal ongoing domestic plans, or sabotage the enemy home front. At the outbreak of the war neutral countries became hubs for spies from both sides; This was the case of the neutral Netherlands.\n\"Mata Hari\" was the stage name of Margaretha Geertruida Zelle, a Dutch exotic dancer and courtesan. Before the war she was known for her promiscuous and flirtatious performances, embodying the idea of the bohemian artist, ofter performing in the nude and only wearing bejeweled breastplates and headwear.\nBeing a Dutch citizen Zelle was allowed to travel freely, yet never too close to the front. When she asked to meet her lover, a Russian general fighting for the Entente on the western front whom she had seduced, after he was wounded in battle, Zelle was approached by the Deuxième Bureau, the French intelligence agency, with an offer to spy on the German crown prince Wilhelm and report any valuable military intelligence. She accepted to spy for the French, but in a metting with a German attaché in neutral Madrid she allegedly agreed to be a double-agent for the Germans.\nThe Deuxiéme Bureau caught wind of Zelle's turning through an intercepted communication, and once it could be confirmed she was arrested in Paris. Zelle was put on trial, although neither the British nor the French could produce reliable evidence of her betrayal. Zelle allegedly defended herself while on trial: \"A harlot? Yes, but a traitoress, never!\".\nThe trial of \"Mata Hari\" was complicated and animated by war politics, and although she presumably never confessed, Zelle was executed by firing squad on 15 October 1917."

After becoming Chief of the German Great General Staff in 1906 he reviewed and approved Von Schlieffen's plans.\nAt the start of the war Moltke found himself having to deal with both the western and the eastern front, an almost impossible task that caused many of his contemporaries and later historians to blame him for the unsuccessful Marne campaign. It was during this campaign that Moltke the younger's health would start deteriorating, leading to his resignation in September 1914 in favour of Erich von Falkenhayn and his death in 1916."

Nearly 12,000 members of the CLC were housed at Auby-les-Hesdin.\nThe conditions in the camp were harsh for the Chinese labourers who faced strict military discipline, grueling hours and exhausting manual labour. The town was first struck by a cholera outbreak and later on by the Spanish flu. Many labourers lost their lives to these diseases. \nThe CLC represented the first big wave of Chinese immigration in France. Today in Noyelles-sur-Mer the Chinese cemetery still exists; Although most of the graves bear no name, the site means to honor the sacrifice of the Chinese Labour Corps.\n\nthe Chinese Labour Corps - Although China would officially declare war on Germany in 1917 after a German torpedo sunk a ship carrying chinese civillians, a considerable number of Chinese citizens had already been involved in non-belligerant roles since 1916 through the Chinese Labour Corps (CLC). Around 140.000 men were enlisted, mostly poor farmhands from northern China and younger students to serve as translators. The CLC performed grueling jobs in harsh conditions for little to no pay in the rear lines: building and repairing roads and railways, unloading cargo from ships and trains, building fortifications, digging trenches, filling sandbags, constructing munitions depots and other such tasks were their main focus.\nThe CLC's significant contribution was barely recognised at the end of the conflict.; The men of the Labour Corps were, in fact, denied te right to settle or receive citizenship. Even today their memory remains mostly erased: of the circa 40,000 British Great War memorials not one remembers the deeds of the CLC."

Turin had always been an industrial city and during the Great War the city's factories contributed to the war effort. \nAt the outbreak of the war most of Turin's population held anti-interverntionists views. It is no wonder that in the summer of 1917, after seeing many young men conscripted, the prices of food skyrocket, and even the city's great theater converted into ammunition depot, the city erupted in one of Italy's biggest anti-war revolt which left around 60 dead and 200 injured."

Regardless, Scaroni was able to perform an emergency landing and was later awarded the bronze medal of military valor.\nAfter the Great War Scaroni's experience as a pilot and air advisor was then put to use in Chiang Kai-Shek's China, only returning in Italy after the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese war.\nHis role as air commander for Sicily during the second world war put him at odds with Herrmann Göring, a professional conflict which cost him his job."
